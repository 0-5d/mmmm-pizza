    <p>ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>shorts can be made from virtually any ingredient, however most choose materials which would 
            typically be used to make clothing such as cotton or perhaps even a polyester blend</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>first you can either <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Shorts">make your own shorts</a> or choose 
            from a variety of ready made shorts at your nearest retailer!</li>
        <li>with shorts in hand it's time to enjoy those scrumptuous shorts we've been waiting for, lets tart with shoving them in your mouth </li>
        <li>begin chewing</li>
        <li>and continue chewing</li>
        <li>repeat step 4 until one day said shorts can feasibly be swallowed without killing you</li>
    </ol>
